## Exploratory Data Analysis

This folder contains a few Jupyter notebooks and other Python scripts to fetch, clean, and merge data for downstream analysis. This is done in four different broad categories:
- Rainfall (rainfall, surface temperatures, GDP, )
- GDP (agricultural output, prices, unemployment, etc.)
- Demonstrations (datasets containing public demonstrations around the globe)
- Agriculture Surface Temp (more agriculture and surface temperature data)

Note that there are redundancies because individual contributors worked on different datasets and did exploratory data analysis. These datasets are merged in a larger, singular dataset in [02_dataset](../02_dataset/).
